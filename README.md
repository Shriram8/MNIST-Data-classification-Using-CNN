# MNIST-Data-classification-Using-CNN

The MNIST database ( National Institute of Standards and Technology ) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.It was created by "re-mixing" the samples from NIST's original datasets.

It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.
The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.

CONFUSION MATRIX:
A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (or "classifier") on a set of test data for which the true values are known. 

In this classification notes I have done Classification on ECG dataset along with MNIST Dataset.
